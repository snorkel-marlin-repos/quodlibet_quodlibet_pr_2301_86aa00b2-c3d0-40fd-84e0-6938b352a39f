Some info on the file formats contained here:

Symbolic Icons (``*-symbolic.svg.in``)
    Manually adjusted symbolic variants of the real application icons. The
    ``build-symbolic.sh`` script invokes Inkscape to change strokes to paths
    so they can be recolored at runtime by GTK+. The result will be copied to
    ``quodlibet/images/hicolor/scalable/``.

Man Pages (``*.1``)
    These are autogenerated using rst2man and the source can be found
    in ``docs/guide/commands``

Desktop Files (``*.desktop.in``) and AppData Files (``*.appdata.xml-in``)
    These can be edited here, but will be changed to include translations
    on installation.

D-Bus Service Files (``*.service.in``)
    These depend on the installation path, so get changed during
    installation.

GNOME Search Provider (``quodlibet-search-provider.ini``)
    Gets copied as is for GNOME to know that Quod Libet can provide
    a search provider (currently through a plugin)
